# Tarjan's Algorithm
Tarjan's algorithm is used to find the strongly connected components in a graph using DFS.

## Algorithm :
1. Initialize both `discovery` and `low` array with -1.
2. Take a variable which denotes the id at which a vertex was first discovered and initialize it to 0
3. Start the DFS from vertex 0
4. If the vertex is not already discovered then set `discovery[vertex] and low[vertex] to be id`` and increment id by 1 for next node.
